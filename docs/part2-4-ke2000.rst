This class is written for the Keithley2000 digital multimeter. It supports following methods.

---------------
Read DC voltage
---------------
- Syntax: read_DCV(instr)
- Description: The only argument of this method is the instrument object (it's generated by the adapter library), it returns the measured DC voltage.

---------------
Read AC voltage
---------------
- Syntax: read_ACV(instr)
- Description: The only argument of this method is the instrument object, it returns the measured AC voltage.

---------------
Read DC current
---------------
- Syntax: read_DCI(instr)
- Description: The only argument of this method is the instrument object, it returns the measured DC current.

---------------
Read Resistance
---------------
- Syntax: read_RES(instr)
- Description: The only argument of this method is the instrument object, it returns the measured resistance value.
