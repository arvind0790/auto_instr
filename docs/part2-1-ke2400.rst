===================================
Keithley 2400- Source Measure Unit
===================================

This class is written for the Keithley2400 source meter. It supports following methods.

------
Off/On
------
- Syntax: off(instr) and on(instr) 
- Description: The only argument of this method is the instrument object (it's generated by the adapter library), it turns off or on the output.

--------------------------------------
Force current measure voltage
--------------------------------------
- Syntax: v1 = forImeasV(instr, current, volt_cmpl)
- Description: The arguments of this method are instrument object, current to be forced and the voltage compliance limit respectively. It returns the measured voltage value. 

--------------------------------------
Force voltage measure current
--------------------------------------
- Syntax: i1 = forVmeasI(instr, voltage, curr_cmpl)
- Description: The arguments of this method are instrument object, voltage to be forced and the current compliance limit respectively. It returns the measured current value.

--------------------------------------
Force voltage measure voltage
--------------------------------------
- Syntax: v2 = forVmeasV(instr, voltage, volt_cmpl)
- Description: The arguments of this method are instrument object, voltage to be forced and the voltage compliance limit respectively. It returns the measured voltage value. This method to be used for 4-Wire sense. One has to manually enable 4W sense on the instrument before using method. If the 2W sensing is used with this method, the measured voltage will be same as forced voltage.

----------
Auto range
----------
- Syntax: autorang_forVmeasI(instr) or autorang_forImeasV(instr)
- Description: The only argument of this method is the instrument object, it set the instrument in auto range mode.

--------
Note:
--------
- Force and measure methods turns on the output of instrument. No need of turning on the instrument separately.

---------
Examples
---------
- **my_smu = gpib.addr(0,12)**, creates the instrument object for Keithley source meter connected via gpib.
- **ke2400.autorang_forVmeasI(my_smu)**, sets the smu in auto range for source voltage measure current mode.
- **i_measured = ke2400.forVmeasI(my_smu, 10, 0.01)**, sets output voltage = 10 V, current compliance = 10mA, turns on the output , measures and return the current value.
